Smol AWS Engineer : Change Log

----------------------------------
April 18 2025
- removed the aws ec2 tool from the tool list 

I did some more testing with grok2 and the newer grok-3-mini reasoning model. 
It seems like smolagents doesn't work with reasoning models. As far as I can tell 
it is failing to parse code from the output, It just displays blank lines for the code.

Grok2 continues to work well if you tell it to use boto3 in your prompt.
Amusingly with the ec2 tool enabled it seems to feel like it should be using it - even in cases 
where it doesn't make sense. I think this is a general flaw with using smolagents as a aws tool - 
basically the model can write boto3 code better than it can use tools that you write for it.

----------------------------------
March 29 2025
- switched over to using env variables for the llm server config data 

start_server.example is a example of how you would use a shell script 
to set the env variables and start the server. 

tested openrouter with grok2 as a alternative to a locally hosted model 
and confirmed it worked well

----------------------------------
March 18 2025
- added get_aws_ec2_instances tool

added a tool to test custom tool use. 

it works fine but the 8b model still takes a couple tries to actually return 
the results from it. i suspect a larger model would be a lot better

----------------------------------
March 10 2025
- added a cron option

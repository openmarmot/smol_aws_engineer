Smol AWS Engineer : Change Log

----------------------------------
March 29 2025
- switched over to using env variables for the llm server config data 

start_server.example is a example of how you would use a shell script 
to set the env variables and start the server. 

tested openrouter with grok2 as a alternative to a locally hosted model 
and confirmed it worked well

----------------------------------
March 18 2025
- added get_aws_ec2_instances tool

added a tool to test custom tool use. 

it works fine but the 8b model still takes a couple tries to actually return 
the results from it. i suspect a larger model would be a lot better

----------------------------------
March 10 2025
- added a cron option
